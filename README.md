## Maverik_Capstone_VinayKumar

## Introduction:

Maverik plans to open/build 30 new stores each year to continue with the high growth it is currently experiencing. Maverik must have accurate first-year sales forecasts for the new stores it plans to open, which will help it build the financial plan more effectively.

The project's focus includes the comprehensive development of a time series forecasting model, integrating both the provided qualitative data and network-wide seasonality patterns. The ultimate output will consist of precise forecasts for the initial year of sales for the new store. It's crucial to emphasize that the project will not encompass intricate financial planning beyond sales forecasting, real-time data integration, or in-depth ROI calculations.

## Project Objectives:

1.Provide accurate first-year sales forecasts for new stores.
2.Support well-informed financial decision-making.
3.Having accurate forecasts will help put together financial plan more effectively and may help Maverik create more accurate initial ROI documents.
4.Ensure the model's capability to update forecasts based on new actual data for the site, ensuring a continuous improvement in forecast accuracy.

## Group's solution to the business problem:

The proposed solution from our group involves the development and implementation of XGBoost machine learning model using Python. This model will incorporate both qualitative data and network-wide seasonality patterns to generate daily-level forecasts for various sales metrics. The use of machine learning algorithm will enable the model to adapt and refine its predictions as new actual data becomes available for each site. By focusing on the continuous improvement of forecast accuracy, our solution aims to provide Maverik with a reliable and adaptable tool for effective decision-making, optimizing resource allocation, and achieving the desired return on investment.

## Your contribution to the project:

1. Conducted EDA on Time Series, Qualitative, and Merged datasets.

2. Analyzed descriptive statistics of Time Series dataset, including Average Fuel & Non-Fuel sales.

3. Explored correlation matrix of target variables with other features.

4. Engaged in feature engineering to enhance model performance.

5. Created ARIMA and Prophet models for time series forecasting.

6. Presented results of the Prophet model, supported by insightful visualizations.

7. Contributed to the Introduction, framing pertinent questions, and summarizing key results in the report.

8. Contributed Inputs for the Final PPT.

## The business value of the solution:

We have done the analysis of 5 Test stores we have considered and concluded that the important features of two stores 22855,22120 need to be incorporated in the new stores that Maverik plans to establish
The New Ideal Store should have the following features but not limited to :
1. Square Feet of the new store should be more than > 4970 feet.
2. Number of parking spaces should be > 25
3. Freals should be offered.
4. Number of traditional forecourt fueling positions >19
5. Median income of 1-mile radius population > $40,000
6. Population within 1-mile radius > 7,500 people

## Difficulties that your group encountered along the way:

While working on the project, our group encountered several challenges that required careful consideration and problem-solving:

### 1. Data Quality and Preprocessing: 
Ensuring the quality of the time series and qualitative datasets posed challenges, with the need for thorough data cleaning and preprocessing to handle the data of 37 stores

### 2. Complexity of Time Series Patterns:
Understanding and modeling the complex patterns within the time series data, especially considering seasonality variations, required a thoughtful approach and collaboration to choose appropriate forecasting techniques.

### 3. Model Selection and Tuning: 
Selecting and fine-tuning forecasting models, such as XGBoost,ARIMA,SARIMA,Random Forest and Prophet, required iterative experimentation to achieve optimal performance, considering the uniqueness of Maverik's sales data. 

## What you learned in the project: 

The project provided valuable learning experiences and insights, contributing to both technical and collaborative skills. Here are some key takeaways:

### 1. Data Handling and Preprocessing: 
Dealing with real-world datasets involved mastering techniques for data cleaning, handling missing values, and preprocessing to ensure the quality and integrity of the data.

### 2. Time Series Forecasting: 
Acquiring a deep understanding of time series forecasting techniques, including the implementation of XGBoost,ARIMA,SARIMA and Prophet models, enriched our knowledge in effectively capturing and predicting complex patterns within sequential data.

### 3. Collaborative Teamwork: 
Working within a team taught the importance of effective collaboration, clear communication, and coordinating individual contributions to ensure a cohesive and comprehensive project outcome.

### 4. Problem-Solving and Adaptability: 
Overcoming challenges, such as data integration complexities and model selection, enhanced problem-solving skills. Adaptability to evolving requirements and continuous refinement of approaches were crucial.

### 5. Business Value Considerations: 
Recognizing the business implications of our work, including the optimization of resource allocation, informed financial decision-making, and impact on Maverik's ROI, deepened our understanding of the broader context of data analytics projects.

### 6. Presentation and Communication Skills: 
Preparing and presenting results to stakeholders improved our ability to convey technical concepts in a clear and concise manner, fostering effective communication with both technical and non-technical audiences.

### Overall, the project provided a holistic learning experience that transcended technical aspects, emphasizing the importance of collaboration, adaptability, and a business-oriented mindset in the field of data analytics.
