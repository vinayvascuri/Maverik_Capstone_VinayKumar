## Maverik_Capstone_VinayKumar

## Introduction:

Maverik plans to open/build 30 new stores each year to continue with the high growth it is currently experiencing. Maverik must have accurate first-year sales forecasts for the new stores it plans to open, which will help it build the financial plan more effectively.

The project's focus includes the comprehensive development of a time series forecasting model, integrating both the provided qualitative data and network-wide seasonality patterns. The ultimate output will consist of precise forecasts for the initial year of sales for the new store. It's crucial to emphasize that the project will not encompass intricate financial planning beyond sales forecasting, real-time data integration, or in-depth ROI calculations.

## Project Objectives:

1.Provide accurate first-year sales forecasts for new stores.
2.Support well-informed financial decision-making.
3.Having accurate forecasts will help put together financial plan more effectively and may help Maverik create more accurate initial ROI documents.
4.Ensure the model's capability to update forecasts based on new actual data for the site, ensuring a continuous improvement in forecast accuracy.

## Group's solution to the business problem:

The proposed solution from our group involves the development and implementation of XGBoost machine learning model using Python. This model will incorporate both qualitative data and network-wide seasonality patterns to generate daily-level forecasts for various sales metrics. The use of machine learning algorithm will enable the model to adapt and refine its predictions as new actual data becomes available for each site. By focusing on the continuous improvement of forecast accuracy, our solution aims to provide Maverik with a reliable and adaptable tool for effective decision-making, optimizing resource allocation, and achieving the desired return on investment.
