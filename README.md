# Introduction:

Maverik plans to open/build 30 new stores each year to continue with the high growth it is currently experiencing. Maverik must have accurate first-year sales forecasts for the new stores it plans to open, which will help it build the financial plan more effectively.

The project's focus includes the comprehensive development of a time series forecasting model, integrating both the provided qualitative data and network-wide seasonality patterns. The ultimate output will consist of precise forecasts for the initial year of sales for the new store. It's crucial to emphasize that the project will not encompass intricate financial planning beyond sales forecasting, real-time data integration, or in-depth ROI calculations.
